### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am looking for open-source .NET repositories to contribute to. Here's what I love working on
- Blazor (Server!)
- ASP.NET Core (Minimal APIs!)
- Unity

Here are a few of my interests:
- HLSL
- [Polyglot Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)
- Math!
- Japanese

Check out my projects at [retruate.studio](https://retruate.studio)
- I regularly look for code to migrate from my closed-source projects into open-source repositories. If you see anything that catches your eye, please let me know at ``contact at retruate dot studio``!
